                "Exploratory investigation into the \"Collapse Hypothesis\". Compares local geometric structure between supervised (cross-entropy) and self-supervised (contrastive) representations. Preliminary results suggest that contrastive objectives may preserve local linear fibers that are collapsed under supervised training."
