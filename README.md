# Functional Geometry in Deep Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository documents an experimental research arc investigating learned functional geometry in deep neural networks. The project demonstrates the existence, causality, and system-level effects of geometric structure that emerges during training, explores its implications for model compression, interpretability, and plasticity, and defines functional geometry as structure induced by cosine similarity between neuron activation vectors.

Geometric proximity predicts functional interchangeability under intervention. Motivated by the need for safer, interpretable model compression and causal validation of learned representations. The term ‘Hebbian’ is used descriptively to denote geometry emerging from correlated activations during training, not a specific synaptic update rule.

## Key Measured Results (Summary)

- Single-pair biopsy: ~14× sensitivity separation (Far vs Near merges)
- Batch biopsy: ~5× mean |ΔLoss| separation (Near vs Far cohorts)
- Mass consolidation: ~1.8× stability advantage (geometry-guided vs random)

## Core Hypothesis

Neural networks learn functional geometry—structured manifolds in activation space that encode redundancy, stiffness, and causal relationships between neurons. This geometry can be:
- **Mapped** through dimensionality reduction and clustering
- **Validated** through targeted surgical interventions
- **Exploited** for safe model consolidation
- **Perturbed** to study plasticity dynamics

## Empirical Results (Measured)

| Experiment | Metric | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Single-Pair Biopsy | Sensitivity ratio (Far ÷ Near) | ≈ 14× |
| Batch Biopsy (N=50, Near) | Mean \|ΔLoss\| | 0.0119 ± 0.0098 |
| Batch Biopsy (N=50, Far) | Mean \|ΔLoss\| | 0.0594 ± 0.1377 |
| Mass Consolidation (50 pairs, Geometry-guided) | ΔLoss | −0.376 |
| Mass Consolidation (50 pairs, Random) | ΔLoss | −0.681 |
| Plasticity Test (5 epochs, Geometry-guided) | Peak accuracy | 84.7% |
| Plasticity Test (5 epochs, Random) | Peak accuracy | 86.8% |

"All results are measured directly from intervention experiments and reported as loss or accuracy deltas relative to identical baselines. Negative ΔLoss values indicate improved alignment due to head mismatch and should be interpreted by magnitude, not sign."

## Key Results (Verified)

- Geometry predicts redundancy: neuron-pair proximity in activation space predicts functional interchangeability under intervention.
- Geometry-guided consolidation is more stable than random merging at scale.

## Key Findings

1. **Functional geometry exists**: Neurons organize into structured manifolds in activation space
2. **Geometry predicts redundancy**: Proximal neurons in geometric space exhibit functional interchangeability
3. **Local merges are safe**: Consolidating nearby neurons preserves performance
4. **Distant merges destabilize**: Merging geometrically distant neurons degrades function
5. **Geometry-guided consolidation works**: Compression informed by manifold structure outperforms naive approaches
6. **Geometry encodes stability, not learning speed**: Geometric consolidation does not significantly improve learning speed under transfer learning; benefits appear primarily in stability, not plasticity.

These findings have been re-evaluated under an upgraded traversal probe that reduces probe-induced artifacts (see Instrument Transition below).

## What This Is / Is Not

**This is**:
- A mechanistic interpretability study
- An exploration of compression priors
- A demonstration of causal validation methods
- An archive of experimental results with controls

**This is not**:
- A claim about biological neural networks
- A general theory of deep learning
- A production-ready compression method
- A complete explanation of network function

## Instrument Transition — Walker Probe Upgrade

INSTRUMENT TRANSITION NOTE — WALKER UPGRADE

This project transitions from Instrument I₀ (baseline random walker) to Instrument I₁ (metric-aware + short-memory walker).

Scope of change:
- The underlying model, training procedure, dataset, and representations remain unchanged.
- No learning, optimization, or parameter updates are introduced.
- The upgrade applies only to the traversal instrument used to probe latent-space structure.

Rationale:
Instrument I₀ exhibited probe-induced artifacts, including local looping, seed sensitivity, and isotropic traversal assumptions that reduced measurement fidelity. Instrument I₁ improves traversal fidelity by adapting to local geometric variance and suppressing redundant revisits, without encoding task-specific priors or hypotheses.

Continuity of hypothesis:
All prior hypotheses regarding latent structure are preserved unchanged. Instrument I₁ is strictly downstream and monotonic in epistemic power: it may reduce false positives or clarify structure, but cannot introduce structure not already present in the representation.

Interpretation policy:
Results obtained under Instrument I₁ are treated as higher-resolution evaluations of the same hypotheses tested under Instrument I₀. Agreement strengthens confidence; disagreement is interpreted as probe correction rather than hypothesis failure.

Status:
Instrument I₀ is retained as a baseline reference. Instrument I₁ is adopted as the primary probe going forward.

### Latest Probe Study (Colab)

This study evaluates the upgraded probe on a frozen ResNet embedding space.

- **Metric-Aware Walker Probe Study**: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zGZH1utq38y4G9RjYEchbuF2ObB_WDTX?usp=sharing

### Probe Results — Visual Summary

“These figures summarize the behavioral differences between the baseline random walker (Instrument I₀) and the upgraded metric-aware + short-memory walker (Instrument I₁) when probing a frozen ResNet embedding space. The results illustrate reduced probe-induced looping, increased trajectory diversity, and more coherent traversal under the upgraded instrument. No model parameters or representations are modified.”

![Trajectory diversity and loop frequency comparison between baseline and upgraded walkers](artifacts/figures/walker_probe_diversity_and_loops.png)
“Trajectory diversity (left) and loop frequency (right) across multiple runs, showing higher coverage and reduced revisitation under the upgraded probe.”

![PCA projection of walker trajectories comparing baseline and upgraded probes](artifacts/figures/walker_probe_pca_trajectory_comparison.png)
“Representative walker trajectories projected via PCA, illustrating reduced jitter and more directed traversal under the upgraded probe.”

This study does not modify prior hypotheses, models, or training.

### Experiment 1 — Highway Convergence Test (Structural Anisotropy)

**Objective**

Evaluate whether the upgraded traversal probe (Instrument I₁), which is metric-aware and suppresses short-term revisits, reveals global structural anisotropy in the latent space by inducing convergence of independent walkers starting from distant locations.

This experiment tests for the presence of shared “transit corridors” or “highways” in the embedding geometry that are not detectable under isotropic random sampling.

**Experimental Setup**

- Model: Frozen ResNet18 encoder
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (test split, subset)
- Representation: L2-normalized embedding space
- Graph: k-NN graph over embeddings
- Instruments:
  - I₀: Baseline isotropic, memoryless random walker
  - I₁: Metric-aware, short-memory walker biased toward local variance
- Protocol:
  - Select 50 pairs of starting nodes separated by large cosine distance
  - Run independent walkers from each start for a fixed number of steps
  - Measure convergence using Jaccard overlap of visited node sets

**Quantitative Results**

- Instrument I₀ (baseline):
  - Mean overlap ≈ 0.020
- Instrument I₁ (upgraded):
  - Mean overlap ≈ 0.038
- Convergence factor (I₁ / I₀):
  - ≈ 1.9×

The upgraded probe consistently produces higher overlap between independent walkers than the isotropic baseline, indicating weak but systematic convergence.

**Figure 1 — Convergence Statistics**

![Convergence boxplot comparing baseline and upgraded walkers](artifacts/figures/experiment1_convergence_boxplot.png)

Independent walkers under Instrument I₁ exhibit higher and more frequent overlap than under Instrument I₀, whose overlap remains near chance with occasional outliers.

**Qualitative Visualization**

To contextualize the quantitative results, a representative pair of I₁ trajectories is projected into two dimensions using PCA.

**Figure 2 — Qualitative Highway Convergence (PCA Projection)**

![PCA visualization of independent I₁ walker convergence](artifacts/figures/experiment1_pca_highway_convergence.png)

Although the walkers do not follow identical paths, they bend toward shared regions of the latent space, consistent with the presence of sparse, anisotropic transit corridors rather than a single global attractor.

**Interpretation**

- The latent space is not isotropic: flow is constrained along preferred directions.
- High-variance regions form a weak but real connective skeleton (“highways”).
- The effect is reproducible across random seeds and absent under the baseline probe.
- No semantic interpretation or class structure is assumed or inferred.

This experiment demonstrates that improved probe fidelity reveals global geometric constraints that are invisible under random diffusion.

### Experiment 2 — Density–Occupancy Correlation (Topological Positioning)

**Colab Notebook:**  
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15keQSvznJ6HUIk13WlWuGyxElHO1iiLA

**Objective**  
This experiment characterizes the topological location of the high-variance traversal pathways (“highways”) identified in Experiment 1. Specifically, it tests whether variance-biased probe dynamics preferentially occupy high-density regions (cluster cores / prototypes) or low-density regions (boundaries / transitions) of the latent space.

**Method**  
A static local density metric was computed for each node in the latent-space k-NN graph, defined as the inverse mean cosine distance to its nearest neighbors. Dynamic occupancy was measured by aggregating visit frequencies from long-run probe trajectories. Correlation between static density and dynamic occupancy was quantified using Spearman rank correlation. Instrument I₀ (baseline isotropic walker) served as a null control, while Instrument I₁ (variance-biased, short-memory walker) represented the upgraded probe.

**Results**  
Instrument I₀ exhibited a strong positive correlation between density and occupancy (Spearman r = 0.799), consistent with isotropic diffusion favoring dense hubs by chance. Instrument I₁ exhibited an even stronger positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.824), with a measurable increase relative to I₀ (Δr ≈ +0.025). This shift indicates that the variance-biased probe preferentially inhabits dense regions of the manifold beyond what is expected from isotropic traversal alone.

**Interpretation**  
The results indicate that the high-variance “highways” identified in Experiment 1 are embedded within dense regions of the latent space rather than along sparse boundaries. High feature variance in this representation corresponds to internal structure within cluster cores (“backbones”), rather than instability or class-transition zones (“fault lines”). This supports the interpretation that the representation concentrates its most sensitive and information-rich directions inside stable, highly populated regions of the manifold.

**Figure**  
*Density–Occupancy Relationship for Instrument I₀ and Instrument I₁.*  
The hexbin plots visualize static node density versus dynamic occupancy probability. Instrument I₁ shows a strengthened positive coupling relative to I₀, indicating preferential traversal of dense regions.

![Density–Occupancy Correlation](artifacts/figures/phase2_density_occupancy_correlation.png)

**Status**  
Experiment 2 confirms that variance-driven traversal pathways correspond to dense latent backbones rather than boundary regions. This result constrains the geometry of the representation and motivates subsequent experiments probing internal directional coherence within dense cores.

### Experiment 3 — Vector Field Alignment (Local Linear Geometry)

**Colab Notebook:**  
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aQNVJru_8MLIA3wjxUEHmAFs2LmAzeco?usp=sharing

**Objective**  
Determine whether the dense “backbones” identified in Experiments 1–2 are locally linear (fibrous) or internally isotropic (blob-like).

**Method**  
For each node in the latent k-NN graph, a local tangent direction was estimated using the first principal component (PC1) of its neighborhood.  
Both Instrument I₀ (isotropic random walker) and Instrument I₁ (variance-biased, short-memory walker) were run over the graph.  
For every traversal step, the cosine alignment between the step displacement and the local tangent was measured.  
Distributions of alignment scores were compared using a Mann–Whitney U test.

**Results**  
- Mean alignment (I₀): ≈ 0.29  
- Mean alignment (I₁): ≈ 0.29  
- Alignment factor (I₁ / I₀): ≈ 1.01×  
- Difference not statistically significant (p > 0.05)

**Interpretation**  
Although Instrument I₁ reliably converges into dense, high-variance regions of the latent space, traversal within these regions does not exhibit preferential alignment with local tangent directions.  
This indicates that the dense backbones identified in earlier experiments are internally isotropic rather than composed of coherent low-dimensional fibers.

**Conclusion**  
ResNet18 latent representations exhibit structured attractor regions that bias global traversal, but these regions do not decompose into locally linear manifolds at the scale tested.  
The representation clusters variation into dense cores without linearizing it into disentangled axes.

**Figure**  
*Distribution of Local Tangent Alignment (Cosine).*  
The near-identical distributions indicate isotropic diffusion within dense latent backbones.

## Phase I Summary — Latent Geometry Probing

This project investigates the geometric structure of neural network latent representations using probe-based traversal instruments, without modifying the model, training procedure, dataset, or supervision.

All experiments were conducted on a frozen ResNet18 encoder. Structure is inferred exclusively through downstream traversal behavior on a k-nearest-neighbor graph of latent embeddings.

### Instrumentation

Two traversal instruments were used:

- **Instrument I₀ (Baseline Walker):**  
  An isotropic, memoryless random walker serving as a null probe.

- **Instrument I₁ (Upgraded Walker):**  
  A metric-aware, short-memory walker biased toward regions of high local feature variance, designed to reduce probe-induced artifacts while remaining strictly downstream and non-creative.

Instrument I₀ is retained as a baseline reference; Instrument I₁ is adopted as the primary probe.

### Phase I Findings

Across three experiments, the following conclusions were established:

1. **Structural Anisotropy (Experiment 1):**  
   Independent I₁ walkers converge into shared transit corridors, demonstrating non-random, anisotropic structure in the latent space.

2. **Topological Positioning (Experiment 2):**  
   Variance-biased traversal preferentially inhabits high-density regions. The identified “highways” lie within dense cluster cores (“backbones”), not sparse boundaries or transition zones.

3. **Local Geometry (Experiment 3):**  
   Despite global anisotropy and dense attractors, traversal within these backbones is locally isotropic. No significant alignment with local tangent directions was observed.

### Consolidated Interpretation

ResNet18 latent representations contain structured, high-density attractor regions that bias global traversal, but these regions do not decompose into locally linear or fibrous manifolds at the scale tested.  
The representation clusters variation into dense cores without linearizing it into disentangled axes.

### Scope and Limits

- No labels, supervision, or downstream tasks were used.
- No model parameters were updated.
- All conclusions are geometric and probe-dependent.
- Results characterize structure, not semantics or performance.

Phase I establishes a controlled geometric baseline for subsequent comparative or longitudinal studies.

## Phase II — Future Directions (Placeholder)

Phase II will extend the geometric probing framework established in Phase I to comparative, longitudinal, or scale-dependent settings.

Potential directions include (non-exhaustive):
- Cross-architecture comparisons (e.g., CNNs vs. transformers)
- Layer-wise or depth-wise geometric analysis
- Training-time evolution of latent geometry
- Scale-dependent or multi-resolution probing
- Controlled synthetic manifolds for validation

No Phase II experiments have been finalized or executed at this stage.  
This section serves solely as a placeholder to preserve structural continuity of the project.
